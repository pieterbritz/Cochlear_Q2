 Singly linked list in Python 3

Expectation:
Question 2:
===========
(Please implement the solution to this question in Python 3 or C. If the implementation is in C, your
mark is discounted by 20%)
For this task you are to implement a singly linked list.
As part of your implementation, please include:
1. A method for inserting new nodes
2. A method for deleting nodes
3. A method for determining the total number of nodes
Finally, put your linked list into action by using your methods to create a linked list consisting of 10
nodes and then printing out the data from the linked list in reverse order.

Planned Solution:
1. Create Node class.
2. Create LinkedList class.
3. Provide a function to insert nodes.
4. Provide a function to delete any node.
5. Provide a function to add up all the nodes in the list
6. Provide a function to print the list in reverse
7. Create a pytest to tests these functions.

Note:
Use "python.exe -m pytest test_OutLinkedList.py" to run the tests.
You can add the -s option to see the printouts to stdout, e.g. "python.exe -m pytest test_OutLinkedList.py -s"
